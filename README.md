# MBE_samples
This is for MBE samples from Kono, et al.2016 MBE paper
Since all of the data from Kono, et al.2016 MBE paper are mapped based on the old reference (contigs), we need to do remapping work
for those samples and call SNPs. Those SNPs can be served as prior SNPs to call SNP for inversion samples and NAM parents samples.
