#   This is from Tom Kono (https://github.com/TomJKono/Misc_Utils/blob/master/Filter_VCF.py)
#   A script to apply various arbitrary filters to a VCF. The three filters
#   I have included here are genotype quality score, number of heterozygous
#   samples, number of samples with missing data, and read depth.
#   All threshholds can be adjusted by modifying the parameters at the top
#   of the script. This script was written with the VCF output from the
#   GATK version 2.8.1. The format may change in the future.
#   This script writes the filtered VCF lines to standard output
